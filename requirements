Task: Implement a basic weather app using the openWeatherMap JSON api that allows the
user to enter a City name and receive the current weather in that city. Please, treat this like
a professional product and make sure not to have any shallow path crashes. I am leaving
the UI design up to you, but I will be using this as a reference for your design abilities. Feel
free to use any libraries of your choosing, just be sure it is compilable in Android Studio.
Create a git repository to hold everything and email me the link when you start so, I can
track progress. As far as timeline is concerned, I was thinking a week but, let me know if
you need more time and we can work around that.
